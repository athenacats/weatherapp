## Introduction

This is a [full stack Angular weather forecasting application ](https://weatherzone-4tow.onrender.com/)  [weatherzone](https://weatherzone-4tow.onrender.com/). The project was meant to be done using simple javascript requests, but I decided to use angular so that I could keep learning about the framework.

To see the website in action, [click here](https://weatherzone-4tow.onrender.com/). Please note it takes the website some time to load up as it is hosted on the free plan.

## Technologies

The application runs on:
- Angular 16.1.4
- Express 4.18.2
- Nodemon 3.0.0

As well as other dependencies and dev dependencies as detailed in the package.json. The site is hosted on the free plan of Render.com

## Setup

To run this project:
- Clone the repository
- Install dependencies and dev dependencies found in package.json

```
$ npm run prebuild
$ npm run build
$ npm start
```

## Project Status

The project is complete.

## Challenges Faced

The project was relatively simple to complete, with the only tough parts being how to implement predictive search and getting the results to display the first time.

## Future Implementation

- Change the weatherapi.com icons to my own icons. The process has already been started, but I opted to pause at it as the list of icons to be replaced is long

## Acknowledgements

I referred to various Angular documentation to get the project up and running. This project was done as an assignment from The Odin Project.
